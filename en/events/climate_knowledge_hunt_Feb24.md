## Register Now!
[Register here](https://forms.gle/nFG5gYHmAGyVbx5X6)

You can register in teams of FIVE individuals of students or early career researchers, everyone is welcome. Feel free to experiment and improvise, maybe you can have one teacher and four students, or five freinds each with a different expertise! 

## About This Event
This Hackathon is planned as a collaborative two day event to showcase our open source tools and research/solutions. 

On the 26th and 27th of February 2024, together with like minded Climate Enthusiasts, we will explore how to extract knowledge from locked literature (such as IPCC reports in PDF format) - using our in house (Open source!) tools and materials over Google Colab and Jupyter notebooks. Your inputs and involvement will be critical for this vision.

We have limited spaces, but we wish to invite 5-10 teams of upto Climate Change enthusiasts or organisations on board, while aiming to:

* Understand and create climate knowledge (esp. IPCC)
* Learn/Develop human/machine knowledge systems
* Make new contacts in the India Climate Landscape
* Feedback knowledge and technology to ClimateHunt

## Event Rationale
We believe in making Knowledge freely accessible to all.

Currently information around the world is largely "published" as monolithic documents. Scholarly publishing is irretrievably broken (cannot be mended), and we use a bottom-up approach to redress this, by promoting Open Data, Open Source software, and Open Standards.

Our emerging story is that we are catalysing the building of a Global Semantic Knowledge Commons for Climate Change (GSKC), a self-improving network of semantic tools. This is a very powerful idea and can transform the way the world collects and uses knowledge. Initially this will be for climateChange and that is why we are (in)formally demonstrating it at our Hackathon. But more importantly, we are using this Hackathon as an opportunity to include many other groups in a self-organizing, bottom-up process.

Our longer term goal is to make this wider and create a community of Climate Enthusiastic Open Scientists by getting other groups involved. Communities grow at their own rate. But we can start using the language and vision!

## Registration Fee & Take Aways
There will be Quizzes and Games throughout the Hackathon. 

A Registration Fee of INR 1000/- is being charged per individual to cover all materials, logistics, meals, accommodation for the duration of the hackathon. The fee is only to be paid by those candaites who are selected to register based on responses on this page/form.

The Winning Team will be awarded a prize amount of INR 15000/-

The First Runner ups will win INR 10000/-

The Second Runner ups will win INR 7000/-

## Program schedule
Detailed Program for 26-27 February, 2024 to be added here soon!

## What Can I Bring?!
* Bring your questions and/or knowledge of climate.
* IT experience (e.g. creating webpages) is valuable but NOT required
* Willingness and excitement to work in small teams!
* We have automated many of the operations such as document retrieval, conversion and analysis.
* We will download public documents from the Web, convert PDFs to HTML and metadata, then perform knowledge extractions and finally add the outcome to WikiData:
* You can suggest other activities or goals.
* Different people will find different things of value to contribute and take away.
* One thing that is always valuable is documentation, so recording what you have done and your impressions, is really valuable - we will help you do that.
* Your social skills will be valuable in making this event a success.

## Our Social Goals
* Get everyone talking naturally and excitedly about the material and the philosophy
* Learn from each other
* Explore the IPCC report in discussion and with simple games
* Find the most important diagram/s for a Chapter
* Test our tools and material
* Emphasize the value of Early Career Researchers
* Explore multilinguality and collaboration
* Spread the word
* Discuss the future!

## Our Technical Goals 
* Introduce participants to Semantic Operations
* Create semantic chapters of the IPCC report
* Current focus / materials are built around four Chapters [AR6/WG3] of the IPCC
* Create per-chapter dictionaries by several methods and link to Wikidata.
* Search chapters with dictionaries and create annotated HTML (already prototyped).
* Encourage technical delegates to explore other chapters automatically

## Event Infrastucture 
* Hosted from NIPGR, New Delhi MRIIRS, NCR, India
* Groups to work in dedicated Theme-specific Teams
* All materials available over Sematic Climate in Github
* Encourage all delegates have Github IDs
* Everyone will get Links to Cloud Workspace over Google Colab
* Communal message tool: We will create a Slack Channel for Delegates

## Getting to Know Each Other
This is really important, especially for creating an interactive environment where delegates know who to approach when in doubt, and we (hosts) know the background experience of delegates. We also wish to group delegates into BreakOuts for the best outcomes, and this needs very careful orchestration

An internship for three months **starting Feb/March 2024** with `#semanticClimate`. 
 
## The Theme
The overall theme will be Climate Justice in India, involving collection of raw metadata from publicly available judicial repositories such as the National Judiciary Data Grid (NJDG) of India. as an intern you will apply various Text and Data mining (TDM) tools, web scrapers or java crawlers that you may download/create/run. A student with expertise in python coding, TDM or AI over NLP will easily be able to do so.

## Mode of Internship 
**The internship format will be online**, and selected interns will work asynchronously in their free time. They are also welcome to visit NIPGR and work with us full time in case they wish to do so. 

## Eligibility 
Anyone with an interest in Climate or Climate justice with some knoweldge of data mining can apply for the internship.  selected interns will work asynchronously in their free time. They are also welcome to visit NIPGR and work with us full time in case they wish to do so. 

## Basis of Selection
**Selection will be made based on a small induction test** for us to ensure the applicant knows what needs to be done; This involves Extracting Metadata for all cases (647 exactly as on date!) that are pending in the Indian Judiciary for the past 30 years. The data is already publicly available in the NJDG portal I mentioned above, but any student who is able to automate, extract and collate this into a CSV format and send it to me within the next week, would be selected for the actual internship! (If we have multiple successful candidates, we may invite them for an informal online interview next week, but the task must be completed within this week.)

## Stipend for Internship
**Successful interns will be paid a Stipend of INR 25000/- per month for upto three months**, depending on their time, availability and ability to collate maximum amount of climate justice records for India and our Biodiversity Hotspots.

An internship for three months **starting Feb/March 2024** with `#semanticClimate`. 
 
## The Theme
The overall theme will be Climate Justice in India, involving collection of raw metadata from publicly available judicial repositories such as the National Judiciary Data Grid (NJDG). As an intern you will explore various Text and Data mining (TDM) tools, web scrapers or java crawlers that you may download/create/run. A student with expertise in python coding, TDM or AI over NLP will easily be able to do so.

## Mode of Internship 
**The internship format will be online**, and selected interns will work asynchronously in their free time. They are also welcome to visit NIPGR and work with us full time in case they wish to do so. 

## Eligibility 
Anyone with an enthusiasm for Climate action with some knoweldge of data mining can apply for the internship. You may continue with your regular day job, studies or other engagements, as long as you can use your free time to get results on this. Selected interns will work asynchronously in their free time. 

## Mode of Selection
**Selection will be made based on a small induction test** for us to ensure the applicant knows what needs to be done; This involves Extracting Metadata for all cases that are pending in the Indian Judiciary for the past 30 years in the Delhi State. 

The data is already publicly available in the NJDG portal: Your induction task is to automate, extract and collate this into a single CSV file and send it to us by end of week Feb 10, 2024. 

* Go to [(NJDG Portal & Click on Delhi State)](https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/njdgnew/?p=main/index&state_code=7~26)
* Scrooll down to the row that says 20-30 Years
* See the number in the last coloum (Total Cases) - it will be something above 600
* Extract the Metadata for each of these cases in CSV format
* Return the combined metadata to us as single file (Our Email at the end of this page)
* Attach a copy of your signed CV along with the data.

  
If we have multiple successful candidates, we may invite you for an informal online interview.
Please do not write to us or apply without the data.

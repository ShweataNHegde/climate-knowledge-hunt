## Liberating and Semantify IPCC Reports

Invitation to participate in the **Formats For Future** hackathon during **Open Access Week 2022 from October 24 to 30** in order to liberate and semantify the IPCC climate change reports.

### How to get started right away

If you want to start right away with the tools and material #semanticClimate provides, [read our posts in the blog section](../../posts/).


## What is the Formats For Future Hackathon?

_Formats For Future_ is a distributed and asynchronous hackathon taking place over the International Open Access Week 2022 to support #semanticClimate in liberating the IPCC reports and other climate change scientific knowledge.

Scientific knowledge is one of the key tools humanity has available to save itself from the worst effects of climate change. The IPCC reports – which outline the effects of climate change, the evidence, likely outcomes, and mitigating actions – are published as a set of PDF files which makes them extremely hard to read by humans or machines, preventing their widespread use.

The #semanticClimate group looks to liberate the IPCC reports by making their content accessible, usable, and semantified – with the goal of making its knowledge accessible and giving citizens next generation publishing tools to work further with the reports.

#semanticClimate is a group of young Indian scientists volunteers developing tools and processes to make the more than 10,000 pages IPCC reports semantic. They recently ran a very successful hackathon [The Climate Knowledge Hunt Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-climate-knowledge-hunt-hackathon-tickets-414825362827) attended by Indian policymakers and climate organisations in September 2022.

## Why register?

Of course you can head over [to the blog section](../../posts) and start right away on your own or with your team. But if you want to get some explanation and support from the #semanticClimate team, you should register. 

Afterwards we will provide you a Zoom link were you can **meet the team every day at 12:30 UTC**. Check a time zone converter of your choice for how late that is at your place.

## How the hackathon works

### The tools for semantify the IPCC reports

#semanticClimate is hands-on – created by young Indian scientists – and uses Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks to turn the (horrible) PDF into HTML. Then tools extract words and phrases to create dictionaries which are linked into Wikidata. The result can be used to build a semantic index and annotation of the report – effectively bring the dead PDF to interactive life.

By using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks no software needs to be installed on your local machine.

### The objectives

- **Create dictionaries:** The first objective is to use the current toolset to create a dictionary for each chapter of the IPCC reports. This will require chapter champions and volunteers to work together in teams on the different chapters. The dictionaries are the first building block to create semantic meaning of the chapters.
- **Improve the workflow:** The second objective is for participants to give feedback and help write the documentation of the workflow and hackathon process to be able to improve the tooling and scale the process.

### How can you take part?

It is anticipated that only 3 hours minimum volunteer time per person is needed over the week.

**What experience do I need to take part in the hackathon?** #semanticClimate is aimed at putting research publications and publishing tools in the hands of people. For this reason the hackathon is designed for people with no prior experience with the publishing tools being used.

**Become a Chapter Champion:** Subject specialists are needed to coordinate dictionary creation for each chapter.

**Hands-on volunteers:** Contributions are needed to: use the workflow and give feedback; help create dictionaries; create documentation and visualisations, and; map workflows.


### Sub-tasks

- The core tooling of Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and semanticClimate repo needs to continue to be tested. It needs more documentation in the Notebook cells/steps.
- Extension to creating chapter dictionaries.
- Testing of annotation and add stemming, works well for abbreviations and single entities.
- Gathering ideas for what to do with the annotated construct by creating user stories.

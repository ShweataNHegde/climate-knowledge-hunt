## About the Event
Are you a climate expert/enthusiast who wants to see how tools can make climate knowledge in scientific reports more accessible? Or are you a tech person who wants to know more about climate and contribute to developing tools to help make sense of the literature? #semanticClimate team is excited to host a hybrid hands-on hackathon on 2023-05-19, where everybody learns about climate and tech by participating in the event!

The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) published the Synthesis report from its Sixth Assessment Cycle in March 2023. The UN Secretary-General called it a “survival guide to humanity”. But this guide is complex, jargon-rich and comes as a dumb PDF. It links to 10,000 pages from other reports. Our diverse team from India has been collaborating virtually for over two years to semantify IPCC reports, to extract knowledge from them. In the hackathon, you will try the tools and make knowledge graphs to navigate the complexed interlinked structure. 

We've chosen [Wikibase](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase) and Wikimedia tools to provide an interactive editing, query and display system for our #semanticClimate knowledge base. We are delighted that senior Wikimedians are working with us and will be present during the hackathon!

You don't need to have a technical background to get started. So, bring your laptops, and let's hack away!

## FAQ
#### What are the technical requirements to participate in the hackathon?
The participants must bring a laptop that can support modern tools written in Python.
#### Do I need to stay for the whole day?
Yes!
#### Do I need computing/programming experience?
No! We will have tested programs online.
#### Why not use ChatGPT?
Because it's not completely trustable and doesn't cover recent material. It doesn't give insights into how it arrives at an answer. Plus, it's not open, and the free version is limited!
#### What would I do during the hackathon?
The participants will be split into smaller teams, each with a theme and #sC team member. The themes may be technical or related to climate topics. Some thought-out ones are:
- Climate dictionaries with Wikidata links
- Knowledge Graph -- create Markdown files that can be read by Obsidian
- Structure of IPCC Reports -- help us work out which bits to read!
- Interface with Wikimedia

Each group will decide on sub-tasks which could involve coding, brainstorming, making ontologies, etc.

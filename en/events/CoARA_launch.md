The CoARA ERIP Working Group, set to launch during the 2024 EU Research & Innovation Week (18-22 March), aims to promote inclusion and integration. The meeting will focus on three main ERIP objectives: creating an outreach program to drive policy, institutional, and societal change in responsible data and AI research; developing policies and tools to ensure research ethics and integrity amidst increasing data and AI usage; and crafting a comprehensive toolkit for implementing best practices in research assessment for data and AI.

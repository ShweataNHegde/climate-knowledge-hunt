#semanticClimate was preceded by CEVOpen (plants) and openVirus (virus). Over the past two years, we have used a lot of technology, developed tools and created documentations. We've also presented at various conferences.

Here are some useful links: 
# semanticClimate
The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) published the Synthesis report from its Sixth Assessment Cycle in March 2023. The UN Secretary-General called it a “survival guide to humanity”. But this guide is complex, jargon-rich and comes as a dumb PDF. It links to 10,000 pages from other reports. Our diverse team from India has been collaborating virtually for over two years to semantify IPCC reports, to extract knowledge from them.
## Outreach 
We presented at Cambridge (MPhil Lecture Series), TDWG 2022, Piaget Hackathon, Open Access Week 2022, UN Library Panel. We have also run our own hackathon -- Climate Knowledge Hunt -- in September. We are running another one in May 2023.

## Technology
### Tools
- [`pyami`](https://github.com/petermr/pyami)
- [`docanalysis`](https://github.com/petermr/docanalysis) and its [tutorial](https://github.com/petermr/docanalysis/wiki/docanalysis-Tutorial)
- [Summarizer](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/Summarization)
- [Keyphrase extraction](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/keyword_extraction/code_v2)

### Knowledge Base
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)
- [Wikibase Instance](https://kg-ipclimatec-reports.wikibase.cloud/)
-  There are some manually created dictionaries for some [chapters of IPCC/AR6/WGIII/](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/ipcc/ar6/wg3)
### IPCC Reports
- [IPCC AR6](https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/tree/main/ipcc)

# openVirus
- [The Repo](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/tree/master)
- [openVirus dictionaries](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/tree/master/dictionaries)
- [Outreach](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/wiki/Outreach)
- The [Wiki page](https://github.com/petermr/openVirus/wiki) has a lot of testing documentation, Wikidata SPARQL Queries, etc. 
# CEVOpen
- [The Repo](https://github.com/petermr/cevopen)
- [CEVOpen dictionaries](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/tree/master/dictionary)
- Again, the [CEVOpen Wiki page](https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/wiki) has a lot of useful resources as well.

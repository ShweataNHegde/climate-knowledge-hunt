#semanticClimate was preceded by CEVOpen (plants) and openVirus (virus). Over the past two years, we have used a lot of technology, developed tools and created documentations. We've also presented at various conferences.

Here are some useful links: 

## openVirus

## cevOpen

# semanticClimate
## Outreach 
We presented at Cambridge (MPhil Lecture Series), TDWG 2022, Piaget Hackathon, Open Access Week 2022, UN Library Panel. We have also run our own hackathon -- Climate Knowledge Hunt -- in September. We are running another one in May 2023.

## An Overview of #semanticClimate Toolkit
The Toolkit consists of a number of components which work together in a toolchain. Thereâ€™s more than one toolchain for different things that we're going to do. The pyami tool takes a PDF and converts it into HTML pages. These HTML pages are processed to get structured or semantic HTML. We also add meaning to a lot of the components of the HTML. We can reorganize, search, or  annotate the structured HTML

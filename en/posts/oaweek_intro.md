# OA Week 2022: Introduction

We are really excited to offer #semanticClimate for OA week. It's a relatively new way of communicating complex topics and 
it's best understood by actually "learning by doing". Don't be frightened by "semantic"; it means using machines to help
with the bits machines are good at ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web]), freeing human brains to do what they are best at. 

"climate" is complex! No human understands everything, so it's critical to link different resources: data, text, simulations, etc. "semantic" means they can all talk to each other. 
> Example: "what does 'GHG' mean and why does it matter?".

# OA Week 2022: Introduction

We are really excited to offer #semanticClimate for OA week. It's a relatively new way of communicating complex topics and 
it's best understood by actually "learning by doing". Don't be frightened by "semantic"; it means using machines to help
with the bits machines are good at ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web]), freeing human brains to do what they are best at. 

"climate" is complex! No human understands everything, so it's critical to link different resources: data, text, simulations, etc. "semantic" means they can all talk to each other. Machine<->machine, human<->machine and human<->human. And anyone can be part of this; if you have resource that could be useful  join us this week! There's so many levels of knowledge and so many subdisciplines

Our approach can be adjusted for any climate approach, but our examples here are:
* The "Mitigation" section of the IPCC report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/)
* Novel searching of the OpanAccess literature (with `pygetpapers`)

## Example: "what does 'GHG' mean and why does it matter?"
 
Many of you will know this means "Greenhouse Gas" in a climate context, but do you know what these gases actually are? 
To answer this we rely heavily on Wikimedia: Wikipedia and Wikidata. You can think of Wikidata as the "data items in Wikipedia articles" (though it's much more than that), and this week (2022-10-20) it passed 100_000_000 items! It's multilingual ([ग्रीनहाउस गैस](https://hi.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%89%E0%A4%B8_%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%88%E0%A4%B8) and we've already had contributions to our notebooks in 7 languages)

The tools were demonstrated via Google Colab to show real-time code execution and results, highlighting their importance in climate data management.

The colab notebook emphasizes on the team's work in converting climate-related scientific literature into semantic formats. The goal is to make such data accessible for everyone, overcoming the limitations of PDF formats for machine readability and data extraction.

#### Key points include:
  - **Introduction of semanticClimate:** A global citizen science movement using open notebook science to "FAIRify" climate data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
  - **Tools showcased:**
        - `pygetpapers`: A tool to search for scientific articles on EPMC (European PubMed Central) and organize metadata into datatables.
        - `docanalysis`: Extracts specific entities, such as countries mentioned in scientific literature.
        - `amilib`: Creates Wikimedia-enhanced dictionaries from scientific terms, linked to Wikimedia pages.

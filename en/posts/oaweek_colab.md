# Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab

Because #semanticClimate creates interactive tools we need to make it easy for 
people to run them. Ananya Singha has brilliantly pioneered the use of Jupyter Notebooks 
and Google Colab and these are the mainstream of our approach.

Jupyter Notebooks are designed as cross-platform tools which run locally. The software 
is easy to install and run. However in #oaweek we expect many people won't want to
do this and so Ananya has set up the notebooks *already installed* in Google Colab.
Colab is a cloud-based resource that is accessed through any browser and you
can start running the notebook immediately. We've provided detailed instructions
but some of you will want to know more and there are many tutorials on the web.
 
## Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an interweaving of text/images and code based on *cells*. Most notebooks
have several steps which you can run in sequence:
```
cell1: read text for step A (human)
cell2: execute step A  (machine)
cell3: read text for step B (human)
cell4: execute step B (machine)
```
This means you can go at your own pace. 

When you become adventurous you can change the parameters in the executable steps, 
e.g. change `Chapter02` to `Chapter07`.

You can't break the program or anyone else's work. And if you don't know what's
going on, we have sessions every day at 1230 UTC.

The main problem people have is pressing buttons in the wrong order. So for the first few goes
concentrate on making sure you run it right. Most steps only take a few seconds, but a few such
as loading the libraries may take a minute.

Notebooks are very good for tutorials and learning and prototyping. It's also possible
to extract the results to disk/drive, but in my experience they don't
scale to productiom

## Google Colab
Google provides a closed, unbreakable enviromment ('Colab') - a collaborative laboratory.
It's free (but you are probably being surveilled by Google). The Colab starts empty so you may need
to build the system (it's automatic, just click the button ).and maybe wait a minute or two. You 
won't have to repeat this.

When you exit the browser the session ends and all installation and results 
will probably be lost. So again it's a learning and prototyping tool.

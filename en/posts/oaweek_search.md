# Openaccess week: searching for climate knowledge

There several ways of searching for knowledge. 

## prepared navigation (e.g. book, movie)


## keyword (supervised) search

The commonest way of searching (Google, Bing, etc.). It relies on the content being text, or indexed into text. For specific terms (e.g. names, 
scientific objects)it can be precise but for general terms (e.g. "justice") it can be very broad. Often the precise term doesn't occur in the 
article and we need synonyms (e.g. "nitrous oxide" is a synonym for "N2O"). 
We tackle this by creating a large expandable set of **dictionaries** 
dictionaries.

## unsupervised search

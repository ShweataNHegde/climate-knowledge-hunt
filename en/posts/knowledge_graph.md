**Knowledge graphs** is a data store that uses the term graph to mean a network where a network nodes are connected by edges.

So in this particular example from Wikipedia we've got a number of nodes which represent subjects and we've got connections or links or edges between them 
which are labeled. So the nodes are labeled and the edge is labled. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here we've got something that says a dog is an animal and that's a very common relationship. 

A dog is an animal. 

A cow is an animal 

An animal is a living thing. 

A plant is a living thing. 

A herb is a plant. 

So those are all **is** relationships. 

And then we have other links. **You can have anything on the link, but it needs to be something which will be computable.** 

So here we've got an additional type of link. cows *eat* herbs


**`Knowledge graphs`** have been associated with linked open data. 

So, here is linked open data:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src='{{ "/static/img/kgraph_2.png" | url }}' width="500" height="100">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And what we have here is an indication of how widespread this concept is. 

So each of these dots here is essentially a collection of related nodes with links in.

One of these might be plants but one might be genes. One might be proteins and so on. So all of the biological components are very well represented.

It can be presented in any other way that is in a computer readable form, a semantic form.

So the machine has to be able to ingest it to give output.
